By hiding the implementation details of a class from the outside world, encapsulation promotes modular programming and reduces the risk of data corruption. Additionally, encapsulation can increase code readability and maintainability by providing a clear separation of concerns.">data encapsulation</a></strong> principle, the fields of a class cannot be directly accessed from other classes. The fields can be accessed only through the methods of that particular class.</p><p>To access hidden fields, programmers write special types of methods: <strong>getters</strong> and <strong>setters</strong>. Getters can only read fields, and setters can only write (<a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, modify refers to the act of changing the value of a variable or object. | This can be done through assignment operators, which alter the value of a variable, or by using methods or functions that change the state of an object. It's important to note that strings in Java are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once created. Instead, a new string must be created if changes are needed.
